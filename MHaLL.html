Mary had a little lamb,<br>
Little lamb, little lamb,<br>
Mary had a little lamb,<br>
Its fleece was white as snow<br>
<p>
Everywhere that Mary went,<br>
Mary went, Mary went,<br>
Everywhere that Mary went<br>
The lambs was sure to go<br>
<p>
It followed her to school one day<br>
School one day, school one day<br>
It followed her to school one day<br>
Which was against the rules.<br>
<p>
It made the children laugh and play,<br>
Laugh and play, laugh and play,<br>
It made the children laugh and play<br>
To see a lamb at school<br>
<p>
And so the teacher turned it out,<br>
Turned it out, turned it out,<br>
And so the teacher turned it out,<br>
But still it lingered near<br>
<p>
And waited patiently about,<br>
Patiently about, patiently about,<br>
And waited patiently about<br>
Till Mary did appear<br>
<p>
'Why does the lambs love Mary so?'<br>
Love Mary so? Love Mary so?<br>
'Why does the lambs love Mary so?'<br>
The eager children cry<br>
<p>
'Why, Mary loves the lambs, you know.'<br>
Loves the lambs, you know, loves the lambs, you know<br>
'Why, Mary loves the lambs, you know.'<br>
The teacher did reply<br>
